# power_terminal

## Things Python should have out of the box.

This package was created when I realised that github copilot was writing most of the code for a terminal controller I was writing by itself. I realised that developers were writing this things by hand.

_fill_: The character the will fill up the progress bar. By default, it's the "â–ˆ" character.<br>
